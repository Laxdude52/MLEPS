Thanks for checking out my project!
This uses machine learning to optimize and control power plants
It is a limited working protoype, using this I will try to obtain more specalized data to develop the system further. 

To run, run the environment file. This acts as a main file would that everything interfaces with.
Currently, models can not be saved and loaded, I am working on that now

Enjoy :)
I got this idea 4 years ago and have been working towards it ever since
